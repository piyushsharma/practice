/**
 * There is an intersection of two roads.
 * First road is road A where cars travel from North to South in direction 1 and from South to North in direction 2.
 * Second road is road B where cars travel from West to East in direction 3 and from East to West in direction 4.
 *
 *
 *
 * There is a traffic light located on each road before the intersection. A traffic light can either be green or red.
 *
 * Green means cars can cross the intersection in both directions of the road.
 * Red means cars in both directions cannot cross the intersection and must wait until the light turns green.
 * The traffic lights cannot be green on both roads at the same time.
 * That means when the light is green on road A, it is red on road B
 * and when the light is green on road B, it is red on road A.
 *
 * Initially, the traffic light is green on road A and red on road B.
 * When the light is green on one road, all cars can cross the intersection in both directions
 * until the light becomes green on the other road.
 * No two cars traveling on different roads should cross at the same time.
 *
 * Design a deadlock-free traffic light controlled system at this intersection.
 *
 * Implement the function void carArrived(carId, roadId, direction, turnGreen, crossCar) where:
 *
 * carId is the id of the car that arrived.
 * roadId is the id of the road that the car travels on.
 * direction is the direction of the car.
 * turnGreen is a function you can call to turn the traffic light to green on the current road.
 * crossCar is a function you can call to let the current car cross the intersection.
 * Your answer is considered correct if it avoids cars deadlock in the intersection.
 * Turning the light green on a road when it was already green is considered a wrong answer.
