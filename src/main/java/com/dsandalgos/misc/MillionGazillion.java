/**
 * I'm making a search engine called MillionGazillionâ„¢.
 *
 * I wrote a crawler that visits web pages, stores a few keywords in a database,
 * and follows links to other web pages.
 * I noticed that my crawler was wasting a lot of time visiting the same pages over and over,
 * so I made a hash set, visited, where I'm storing URLs I've already visited.
 * Now the crawler only visits a URL if it hasn't already been visited.
 *
 * Thing is, the crawler is running on my old desktop computer in my parents' basement
 * (where I totally don't live anymore), and it keeps running out of memory because visited is getting so huge.
 *
 * How can I trim down the amount of space taken up by visited?

	 * Analysis
	 *
	 * Say we store each url separately.
	 * All possible 5 letter urls (with just a-z) = 26 * 26 * 26 * 26 * 26 = 26 ^ 5
	 * To store each url = 5 characters, so total = 5 * 26^5
	 *
	 * Similarly for 4 letter urls => 4 * 26 ^ 4
	 *
	 * If we add all => O(n * 26 ^ n) space
	 *
	 * With tries =>
	 * To store all 5 letter urls => first layer 26 (for each starting letter)
	 * second layer => 26 ^ 2 nodes as each of the first layer has 26 child nodes, ...
	 * ... 5th layer 26 ^ 5 nodes
	 *
	 * So the total becomes 26 ^ 1 + 26 ^ 2 + ... + 26 ^ 5 = O (26 ^ n) space
	 *
	 * we save a factor of "n" by using tries
