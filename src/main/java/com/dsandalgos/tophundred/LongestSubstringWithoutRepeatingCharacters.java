Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

For example:
    The longest substring without repeating letters for "abcabcbb" is "abc",
             which the length is 3.
    For "bbbbb" the longest substring is "b", with the length of 1.

     * By using HashSet as a sliding window, checking if a character in the current can be done in O(1)O(1).
     *
     * A sliding window is an abstract concept commonly used in array/string problems.
     * A window is a range of elements in the array/string which usually defined by the start and end indices,
     * i.e. [i, j)[i,j) (left-closed, right-open). A sliding window is a window "slides"
     * its two boundaries to the certain direction. For example, if we slide [i, j)[i,j)
     * to the right by 11 element, then it becomes [i+1, j+1)[i+1,j+1) (left-closed, right-open).
     *
     * Back to our problem. We use HashSet to store the characters in current window [i, j)[i,j) (j=i initially).
     * Then we slide the index j to the right. If it is not in the HashSet, we slide j further.
     * Doing so until s[j] is already in the HashSet. At this point,
     * we found the maximum size of substrings without duplicate characters start with index i.
     * If we do this for all i, we get our answer.

    /*

    Does it contain ASCII character? unicode set?
    Algo:

    When you have found a repeated character (letâ€™s say at index j), it means that the current substring
    (excluding the repeated character of course) is a potential maximum, so update the maximum if necessary.

    It also means that the repeated character must have appeared before at an index i, where i is less than j.

    Since you know that all substrings that start before or at index i would be less than your current maximum,
    you can safely start to look for the next substring with head which starts exactly at index i + 1.

    Therefore, you would need two indices to record the head and the tail of the current substring.
    Since i and j both traverse at most n steps, the worst case would be 2n steps,
    which the runtime complexity must be O(n).

    Optimization: Could do this in only n steps. Instead of using a table to tell if a character exists or not,
    we could define a mapping of the characters to its index. Then we can skip the characters immediately
    when we found a repeated character.
