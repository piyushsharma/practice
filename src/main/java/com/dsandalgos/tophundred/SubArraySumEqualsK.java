    /**
     * The idea behind this approach is as follows: If the cumulative sum
     * (represented by sum[i] for sum upto ith index) upto two indices is the same,
     * the sum of the elements lying in between those indices is zero.
     *
     * Extending the same thought further, if the cumulative sum upto two indices, say i and j is at a difference of k
     * i.e. if sum[i] - sum[j] = k, the sum of elements lying between indices i and j is k.
     *
     * Based on these thoughts, we make use of a hashmap which is used to store the cumulative sum upto all the indices
     * possible along with the number of times the same sum occurs.
     * We store the data in the form: (sum_i, no. of occurrences of sum_i)
     * â€‹
     * We traverse over the array nums and keep on finding the cumulative sum.
     * Every time we encounter a new sum, we make a new entry in the hashmap corresponding to that sum.
     * If the same sum occurs again, we increment the count corresponding to that sum in the hashmap.
     * Further, for every sum encountered, we also determine the number of times the sum - k has occured already,
     * since it will determine the number of times a subarray with sum k has occured upto the current index.
     * We increment the count by the same amount.
     *
     * After the complete array has been traversed, the count gives the required res.
