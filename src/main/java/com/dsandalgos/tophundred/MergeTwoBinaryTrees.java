/**
 * Given two binary trees and imagine that when you put one of them to cover the other,
 * some nodes of the two trees are overlapped while the others are not.
 *
 * You need to merge them into a new binary tree.
 * The merge rule is that if two nodes overlap, then sum node values up as the new value of the merged node.
 * Otherwise, the NOT null node will be used as the node of new tree.

 Example 1:
 Input:
 Tree 1                     Tree 2
 1                         2
 / \                       / \
 3   2                     1   3
 /                           \   \
 5                             4   7
 Output:
 Merged tree:
 3
 / \
 4   5
 / \   \
 5   4   7
 Note: The merging process must start from the root nodes of both trees.
