public class Fibonacci {




/*

We define a modified Fibonacci sequence using the following definition:

Given terms  ti and ti+2 where i in [1, infinity), term  ti+2 is computed using the following relation:
    ti+2 = ti + (ti+1) ^ 2

Given three integers, t1, t2, and n, compute and print term  of a modified Fibonacci sequence.

Note: The value of tn may far exceed the range of a 64-bit integer.
Many submission languages have libraries that can handle such large results but,
for those that don't (e.g., C++), you will need to be more creative in your solution
to compensate for the limitations of your chosen submission language.

Constraints:
    0 <= t1, t2 <= 2
    3 <= n <= 20
    tn may far exceed the range of a 64-bit integer.
